💻 Overview

👋 Hi, I’m Chan — also known as @Rockforge (or Chansters if you’re feeling friendly).

👀 I’m interested in coding, reading, and occasionally doing absolutely nothing to reset my brain.

🌱 I’m continuously learning and exploring the field of programming, balancing curiosity with practicality. Technology evolves fast, and while it’s exciting to chase new tools and trends, I believe real growth comes from understanding fundamentals deeply rather than burning out on every shiny new thing.

I describe myself as a competent programmer.
Not because I know everything—but because I know that mastering programming is a lifelong process. The learning never ends, and that’s exactly what keeps it interesting.

A programmer’s life is defined by continuous learning, experimentation, and refinement—and that’s the path I aim to stay on.
